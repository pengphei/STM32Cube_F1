@par Description

This application shows how to use thread signaling from an interrupt using CMSIS RTOS API.

This example creates a threads that calls osSignalWait to wait for a signal to set bit1 and bit2 then toggles LED2.

SysTick_Handler calls the function "Toggle_Leds" 
Toggle_Leds calls osSignalSet to send a signal = bit1 to Thread2 if a static counter is > 400 and < 1000
and calls osSignalSet to send a signal = bit1 | bit2 to Thread2 if a static counter is >= 1000
  
As a results the behaviour is a follow :
LED2 toggle every 1000ms  


@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.

on STM32Cube with RTOS".

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103xG devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM3210E-EVAL RevD board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
